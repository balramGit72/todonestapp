# Todo Web API

The Todo Web API is a powerful RESTful API that allows users to efficiently manage their tasks and to-do items. This API is built using modern technologies, including NestJS as the framework, PostgreSQL as the database system, and TypeORM as the ORM library. With this API, users can easily perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their tasks, ensuring efficient task management.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Operations:** The API provides intuitive endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks. It ensures a seamless experience for users interacting with their to-do items.

- **Structured Data:** Tasks are structured with essential details such as title, description, and completion status. This structured data enables users to organize their tasks effectively.

- **Validation and Error Handling:** The API is equipped with robust validation mechanisms, ensuring that incoming data is properly validated and sanitized. Graceful error handling provides users with meaningful error messages.

- **API Documentation:** The API is documented using the Swagger module, allowing users to explore and understand the available endpoints, request payloads, and response structures.

- **Authentication and Security:** The API incorporates JWT-based authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access and manage their tasks. This enhances the security of user data.

- **Testing and Quality Assurance:** The codebase includes unit tests that validate the functionality of the API endpoints. This promotes code quality and ensures reliable performance.
